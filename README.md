# UserBackupper
A simple tool for backupping your Users folder.
# Usage
The tool will ask you which path you want to save in. Then, the program will try to backup every user with everything* that they have (AppData, Desktop, Downloads, etc.).
*SOME folders/files/users may NOT be backed up because of permissions.
