# UserBackupper
My first tool... I tried my best on this one...
Basically, it's a Users Backupper to, well... backup your Users Folder.

# Usage
NOTE : Run the program from the Start menu. I tried to run it from Setup but there was an error. So I removed the option.
When you start the program, a message will warn you if you have enough storage to backup. Press CTRL-C or close to abort. Then, the program will try (with administrative privileges) to backup your Users folder to C:.
